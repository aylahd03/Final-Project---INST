INST 126 Final Project

This program utilizes the NASA Near Earth Object API and Pandas to create a dataframe of asteroids and their closest approach date to Earth. The data is pulled from a 7 day window that the user must specify in the api url(start_date=YOUR START DATE and end_date=7 DAYS LATER). The user must also obtain an api key from NASA to access the data; the key should also be embedded in the api url (api_key=YOUR API KEY). 

This program uses pandas, requests, and json. Requests is used to pull the data from the api and ensures that the request was sucessful(line 14 checks that status code = 200) If the request was unsucessful the program will give you a numerical error. Json then formats the data so that it can be turned into a dataframe using pandas which is what will appear in the terminal.
